**Discord Launcher/Tool**
As you may know, to reduce CPU usage discord processes automaticaly sets to a lower priority state. On a low end computer, this cause interruptions in the audio when talking to other people when the CPU experiences a high load. To mitigate this issue, the discord tool/launcher that I wrote forces discord processes to a designated level of priority. It can also work as a launcher, as there's the option to automatically start discord on launching the app. This launcher/tool is a one click solution to an annoying problem.
