# **Discord Launcher**

## **Why this exists?**
As you may know, to reduce **_CPU usage_** discord processes automaticaly set to a lower priority state. On a low-end computer, this causes **interruptions** in the audio when talking to other people when the **CPU experiences a high load**. 

### **How does it work?**
To mitigate this issue, Discord Launcher **forces discord processes** to stay at a **level of _priority_** chosen by the user.
It uses a **lightweight** process listener module. This application's purpose is to be used on lower-end computers so naturally it's built from the ground up to be **_very light_**.

#### **Why use this as a discord launcher?**

This tool also acts as a fully fledged **launcher** for discord. You might ask yourself why would I complicate my existence by using a launcher to start Discord, but I assure you that **Discord Launcher** can be set-up to be a **1-Click** solution. Who wants to have to open a separate tool every time they use Discord. **Discord Launcher** not only starts Discord, but also starts the priority tool all in a single click!

##### **Who is it for?**

As I said before this launcher is for people with lower-end computers who struggle to keep Discord **responsive** during high CPU load. It can also be used by people that are just looking for a **simple launcher** for Discord.
