# **Discord Launcher**

As you may know, to reduce **_CPU usage_** discord processes automaticaly set to a lower priority state. On a low end computer, this causes **interruptions** in the audio when talking to other people when the **CPU experiences a high load**. To mitigate this issue, the discord tool/launcher that I made **forces discord processes** to a **designated level of _priority_**. It can also work as a **launcher**, as there's the option to automatically start discord on launching the app.


**This launcher/tool is an one click solution to an _annoying problem_.**
